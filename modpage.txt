Welcome to Better Player Mentions, this mod enhances the whole player mentions system of the game! You can find various customizations as well.

<size=150%><b>Settings Guide</b></size><indent=1.5%><line-height=150%>
- <b>Non-Mentions Highlights</b>:<line-height=100%> If someone says your number in chat, it will get colored with the Base Mentions Color (e.g. the chat <color="white">"<color="white">1 is evil</color>"</color> will become <color="white">"<color="white"><color=#FCCE3B>1</color> is evil</color>"</color>).</line-height>
- <b>Highlight Non-Mention Message</b>:<line-height=100%> If someone says your number in chat, it will act as if you were mentioned by it. (e.g. <color="white">"1 is evil"</color> = <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color> is evil"</color> both highlighting the message).</line-height>
- <b>Just show the numbers</b>:<line-height=100%> Mentions will only show the Player Number image, and not the name (e.g. <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color>"</color> becomes <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①</color>"</color>). "Player Mention Effects" setting (found in the menu > chat) must be set to "Show Player Number" in order for this to change anything.</line-height>
- <b>Other's Mentions colored</b>: <line-height=100%>If someone or you mentions someone else and you know their role, it will be colored of their faction. (e.g. if 1 is a revealed Marshal: <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color>"</color> becomes <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①</color><color=#06E00C>Giles Corey</color>"</color>)</line-height>
- <b>Color My Mention</b>: <line-height=100%>Applies "Other's Mentions colored" to your own mention as well.</line-height>
- <b>Other's number colored</b>: <line-height=100%>If someone writes the number of someone(not mention nor you) and you know their role, it will be colored of their faction. (e.g. if 1 is a coven teammate: <color="white">"<color="white">Psychic N1 - G:(1), 4</color>"</color> becomes <color="white">"<color="white">Psychic N1 - G:(<color=#B545FF>1</color>), 4</color>"</color>)</line-height>
- <b>Color My Number</b>: <line-height=100%>Applies "Other's number colored" to your own number as well.</line-height>
- <b>Mention Panel Colored</b>: <line-height=100%>Applies the settings "Other's Mentions colored" and "Color My Mention" to the mentions on the panel that appears when you start typing one.</line-height>
- <b>Colored Input's Mentions</b>: <line-height=100%>Applies the settings "Other's Mentions colored" and "Color My Mention" to the mentions on the panel that appears when you start typing one.</line-height>
- <b>Only Numbers in Inputs</b>: <line-height=100%>You will only write the numbers on mentions in your input. "Just show the numbers" not needed, however Player Mention Effects" setting must still be set to "Show Player Number".</line-height>
- <b>ToS 1 Highlight</b>: <line-height=100%>Instead of the usual colored background it changes the whole chat color just like in ToS 1. This has various options for when it applies:
<indent=4%>- <b>Never</b>: Setting not activated.
- <b>Non-Mentions Highlights</b>: Whenever someone says your number in chat (e.g. <color="white">"<color="white">1 is evil</color>"</color>, will become <color="white">"<color=#FFFF00>1 is evil</color>"</color>). Mentions will override this. "Highlight Non-Mention Message" setting required, "Non-Mentions Highlights" recommended to find the mention more easily (e.g. <color="white">"<color=#FFFF00>1 is evil</color>"</color> would be <color="white">"<color=#FFFF00><color=#FCCE3B>1</color> is evil</color>"</color>).
- <b>Mentions Highlights</b>: Whenever someone mentions you in chat (e.g. <color="white">"<color="white"><color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color> is evil</color>"</color> will become <color="white">"<color=#FFFF00><color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color> is evil</color>"</color>).
- <b>Any Highlight</b>: In both cases it will use ToS 1 highlight instead of the ToS 2 one.</indent></line-height>
- <b>ToS 2 Highlight W ToS 1's</b>: <line-height=100%>When a highlight from ToS 1 appears, the ToS 2 highlight will also be shown. Showing both the colored background and colored text.</line-height>
- <b>ToS 1 Highlight Color</b>: <line-height=100%>Changes the color of the text when a ToS1 highlight occurs (e.g. if set to <color=#1FBDD2>#1FBDD2</color>, <color="white">"<color=#1FBDD2>1 is evil</color>"</color> instead of <color="white">"<color=#FFFF00>1 is evil</color>"</color>). Again, "Non-Mentions Highlights" recommended to find the text more easily (e.g. if set to <color=#1FBDD2>#1FBDD2</color>, <color="white">"<color=#1FBDD2><color=#FCCE3B>1</color> is evil</color>"</color> instead of <color="white">"<color=#1FBDD2>1 is evil</color>"</color>)</line-height>
- <b>ToS 2 Highlight Color</b>: <line-height=100%>Changes the color of the colored background that appears when someone mentions you.(e.g. if set to <color=#1FBDD2>#1FBDD2</color>, <color="white">"<color=#1FBDD2><color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color> is evil</color>"</color> instead of <color="white">"<color=#FFFF00><color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color> is evil</color>"</color>)</line-height>
- <b>Highlight Opacity</b>: <line-height=100%>The amount of opacity that the colored background has.</line-height>
- <b>Base Mentions Color</b>: <line-height=100%>Changes the default color of Mentions (e.g. if set to <color=#1FBDD2>#1FBDD2</color>, <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①</color><color=#1FBDD2>Giles Corey</color>"</color> instead of <color="white">"<color=#FCCE3B>①Giles Corey</color>"</color>). Applies to the color of "Non-Mentions Highlights" as well. Requires the restart of the game to apply its effects.</line-height>
